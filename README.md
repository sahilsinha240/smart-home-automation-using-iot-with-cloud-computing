Smart home systems achieved great popularity in the last decades as they increase the comfort
and quality of life. Most smart home systems are controlled by smartphones and microcontrollers.
smartphone application is used to control and monitor home functions using wireless communication
techniques . Smart Home offers opportunities to save energy and reduce costs, improve the quality of
life and increase security. Home and building automation provide comfort, security, energy savings,
flexibility and adaptability to future development. The purpose of this paper is to make a prototype of
a smart home. It will be equipped with several sensors and a NodeMcu. we present a composition of
three components to build a robust approach of an advanced smart home concept and implementation.

1.1 Introduction

smart home system, internet of things, cloud computing and rule-based event processing, are the building blocks of our proposed advanced smart home integrated compound. Each component contributes its core attributes and technologies to the proposed composition. IoT contributes the internet connection and remote management of mobile appliances, incorporated with a variety of sensors. Sensors may be attached to home related appliances, such as air-conditioning, lights and other environmental devices. And so, it embeds computer intelligence into home devices to provide ways to measure home conditions and monitor home appliances’ functionality. IoT has exaggerated considerably within the previous few years since it’s additional a brand new dimension to the globe of knowledge and communication technologies. For digitalizing home appliances corresponding to lighting, heating, security, audio, video etc. An IoT in home automation is that the best business resolution of late.
1. Smart Home promises the potentials for the user to measure home conditions (. e.g., humidity, temperature, luminosity, etc.),manipulate home (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) appliances and control their status with minimum user’s intervention . Researchers and practitioners have made a great deal of efforts in facilitating the concept.
2. The aforementioned research efforts focus on the Smart home features of context-awareness, energy efficiency, natural interaction, and user activity recognition.
