Smart home systems achieved great popularity in the last decades as they increase the comfort
and quality of life. Most smart home systems are controlled by smartphones and microcontrollers.
smartphone application is used to control and monitor home functions using wireless communication
techniques . Smart Home offers opportunities to save energy and reduce costs, improve the quality of
life and increase security. Home and building automation provide comfort, security, energy savings,
flexibility and adaptability to future development. The purpose of this paper is to make a prototype of
a smart home. It will be equipped with several sensors and a NodeMcu. we present a composition of
three components to build a robust approach of an advanced smart home concept and implementation.

1.1 Introduction

smart home system, internet of things, cloud computing and rule-based event processing, are the building blocks of our proposed advanced smart home integrated compound. Each component contributes its core attributes and technologies to the proposed composition. IoT contributes the internet connection and remote management of mobile appliances, incorporated with a variety of sensors. Sensors may be attached to home related appliances, such as air-conditioning, lights and other environmental devices. And so, it embeds computer intelligence into home devices to provide ways to measure home conditions and monitor home appliances’ functionality. IoT has exaggerated considerably within the previous few years since it’s additional a brand new dimension to the globe of knowledge and communication technologies. For digitalizing home appliances corresponding to lighting, heating, security, audio, video etc. An IoT in home automation is that the best business resolution of late.
1. Smart Home promises the potentials for the user to measure home conditions (. e.g., humidity, temperature, luminosity, etc.),manipulate home (heating, ventilation and air conditioning) appliances and control their status with minimum user’s intervention . Researchers and practitioners have made a great deal of efforts in facilitating the concept.
2. The aforementioned research efforts focus on the Smart home features of context-awareness, energy efficiency, natural interaction, and user activity recognition.

Architecture

Current lifestyles and technologies have inspired new ways to manage home appliances free of restrictions previously imposed by distance and time. So-called home automation technologies allow users to control and schedule common home tasks, often without human intervention. Several types of home automation systems have been proposed and classified show in diagram.smart-home main components and their inter-connectivity. On the left block, the smart home environment, we can see the typical devices connected to a local area network[LAN]. This enables the communication among the devices and outside of it. Connected to the LAN is a server and its database. The server controls the devices, logs its activities, provides reports, answers queries and executes the appropriate commands. For more comprehensive or common tasks, the smart home server, transfers data to the cloud and remotely activate tasks in it using APIs, application programming interface processes. In addition, IoT home appliances are connected to the internet and to the LAN, and so expands smart home to include IoT. The connection to the internet allows the end user, resident, to communicate with the smart home to get current information and remotely activate tasks.

Data Flow

A Data Flow Diagram (DFD) is a traditional way to visualize the information flows within a system. A neat and clear DFD can depict a good amount of the system requirements graphically show in figure[4.2]. It can be manual, automated, or a combination of both.It shows how information enters and leaves the system, what changes the information and where information is stored. The purpose of a DFD is to show the scope and boundaries of a system as a whole. It may be used as a communications tool between a systems analyst and any person who plays a part in the system that acts as the starting point for redesigning a system.
